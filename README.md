- WiFi network
- Computer with VSCode installed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iransamarasekara/medibox.git
cd medibox
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Setup
Connect components according to the [wiring diagram](Docs/Hardware/Hardware_Component_Specification.md#port-map).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Software Installation

#### Install Development Tools
1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
3. Install [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

#### Configure Security Certificate
Create `include/Certificate.h` with your CA certificate:
```cpp
const char *root_ca = R"EOF(
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...your certificate content here...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
)EOF";
```

#### Update Configuration
Edit `include/Definitions.h` with your settings:
```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "your_wifi_name"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your_wifi_password"
#define MQTT_BROKER "your_mqtt_broker_address"
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Deploy

1. **Build the firmware**:
   ```bash
   pio run
   ```

2. **Upload to ESP32**:
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

3. **Start Node-RED**:
   ```bash
   node-red
   ```

4. **Import Dashboard Flow**:
   - Open [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)
   - Import `NodeRed Dashboard/flow.json`

5. **Access Dashboard**:
   - Visit [http://localhost:1880/ui](http://localhost:1880/ui)
